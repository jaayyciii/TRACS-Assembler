***********************************************************************************************************/

Step 1: Open the source file, "Team1_TRACS-ASSY.c", then compile and run. 

	For instances, that you want ensure that the assembly program has been successfully interpreted by the 
	assembler, you can locate line 188 to 196. These are lines of code that you can comment out for checking
 	purposes. Hence, this will display the instructions written in your assembly program after following 
	the required steps.


Step 2: After running, it will open an executable program and will prompt a message to enter the source file path.
 	
	Hence, to do this, locate the txt file of the Assembly program in your computer. Then, copy as path. You
	can use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+C


Step 3: After copying, open the executable program again and paste the copied path. You can use the keyboard 
	shortcut: Ctrl+V

	Example: "C:\Users\_\Documents\AssemblyProgram.txt"


Step 4:	If done successfully, delete the quotation marks (" ") to allow the program to properly locate your file.
	Then, click enter.

	Example: C:\Users\_\Documents\AssemblyProgram.txt


Step 5: Thereafter, it will again prompt a message to enter the destination file path. 

	Hence, to do this, locate the txt file in your computer of where you want the output to be written. If you
	do not have a file for this yet, then create one. 

	The same with Step 2, copy the file as path. You can use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+C


Step 6: After copying, open the executable program again and paste the copied path. You can use the keyboard 
	shortcut: Ctrl+V
	
	Example: "C:\Users\_\Documents\MachineCode.txt"

Step 7: Similar to Step 4, delete the quotation marks (" ") to allow the program to properly locate your file.
	Then, click enter.

	Example: C:\Users\_\Documents\MachineCode.txt


Congratulations! You can now open the destination file to see the machine code output.
